# ecommerce-codes-fashion

This is an ecommerce site for buying clothes built by the devs with their initials making the name D.E.E.O-R.A.M.O.C 

# The Developers are:

- Obi
- Alice
- Micaiah
- Itsetumi
- Emmanuel

# Project Plan for Our E-commerce Store

Alright, since I'm the Project Manager, my job is to make sure we stay organized and actually get this done without stress. No budget, no money involved—just building for the fun of it.

** Team Roles & Responsibilities **

# Me (Okache – Project Manager)

Keep track of progress and make sure things move smoothly.

Assign tasks and check for completion.

Handle any issues and keep everyone aligned.

Document everything (features list, progress, etc.).


# Obi & Emmanuel (Frontend Developers)

Design and build the UI (Home page, product pages, cart, etc.).

Make sure everything looks good and works well.

Connect the frontend to the backend API.


# Micaiah (Backend Developer)

Set up the database (products, users, orders).

Build APIs for the frontend to fetch/store data.

Handle authentication (if needed).

Make sure the backend is secure and works properly.



# Tech Stack We're Using

- Frontend:HTML/CSS (React)

- Backend: Django 

- Database: MongoDB (or MySQL/PostgreSQL if needed).

- Version Control: GitHub (so we don’t mess up each other’s code).


How We’ll Work Together

1. Micaiah builds APIs → Obi & Emmanuel connect them to the frontend.


2. Testing & Debugging as we go (no leaving bugs for "future us" to fix).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
